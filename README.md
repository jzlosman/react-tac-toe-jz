# Key Features

-   **Board Selector** - play on boards of different sizes. Modify the board sizes in App.tsx
-   **Win Detection** - when a player wins or a cat's game occurs, the app will identify it and stop further play.
-   **Match History** - track the wins of each player, including a history of when those wins occured and how many moves were used.
-   **Save/Load** - Save a current board state, and load the most recently saved board state. This persists using localStorage.
